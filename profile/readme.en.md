# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ About Us

## Mission and Vision

**21.000.000** is an open community of developers, educators, and enthusiasts focused on Bitcoin and related technologies. Our goals are to:

- Create and maintain open source tools for the Bitcoin ecosystem
- Educate the Czech public about Bitcoin, its principles, and technologies
- Build robust and secure infrastructure for Bitcoin usage
- Promote financial literacy and self-sovereignty
- Bring together people interested in cryptocurrency freedom and privacy

Our name refers to the maximum number of Bitcoins that will ever exist (21 million), symbolizing one of Bitcoin's key properties - limited supply.
